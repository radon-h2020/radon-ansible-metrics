Welcome to the AnsibleMetrics documentation AnsibleMetrics is a Python-based static source code analyzer for Ansible blueprints that helps to quantify the characteristics of infrastructure code to support DevOps engineers when maintaining and evolving it. It currently supports 46 source code metrics, though other metrics can be derived by combining the implemented ones. It represents a step forward towards closing the gap for the implementation of software quality in-struments to support DevOps engineers when developing and maintaining infrastructure code and the development of measurement models for its quality! How to install Installation is made simple by the PyPI repository. Download the tool and install it with: pip install ansible-metrics or, alternatively from the source code project directory: pip install -r requirements.txt pip install .

Fact modules are modules that do not alter state but rather return data. Knowing the number of fact modules in a playbook could represent a measure of the responsibility of the playbook. The assumption is that the lower the fact modules wrt the total number of modules in the script, the more unstable is the behaviour of the class, as the other modules alter its state. Example The following example has 2 facts modules and three modules in total. tasks: - name: Find all instances in the specified region ali_instance_facts: # 1st fact module alicloud_access_key: '{{ alicloud_access_key }}' alicloud_secret_key: '{{ alicloud_secret_key }}' alicloud_region: '{{ alicloud_region }}' register: all_instances - name: Find all instances based on the specified ids ali_instance_facts: # 2nd fact module alicloud_access_key: '{{ alicloud_access_key }}' alicloud_secret_key: '{{ alicloud_secret_key }}' alicloud_region: '{{ alicloud_region }}' register: instances_by_ids - name: PRINT DATA TO TERMINAL WINDOW debug: # not fact module msg: 'End of tasks' Parameters Type Description Input io.StringIO An ansible playbook Output unsigned int The number of fact modules Exception TypeError If the type of the input parameter is not io.StringIO yaml.YAMLError If the input file is not a valid yaml How to use Below an example on how to call the metric and the expected output for the provided example: from io import StringIO from ansiblemetrics.playbook.num_fact_modules import NumFactModules str = 'tasks:\\n\\t- name: Find all instances in the specified region\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tali_instance_facts:\\n\\t\\t\\talicloud_access_key: \"{{ alicloud_access_key }}\"\\n\\t\\t\\talicloud_secret_key: \"{{ alicloud_secret_key }}\"\\n\\t\\t\\talicloud_region: \"{{ alicloud_region }}\"\\n\\t\\tregister: all_instances\\n\\n\\t- name: Find all instances based on the specified ids\\n\\t\\tali_instance_facts:\\n\\t\\t\\talicloud_access_key: \"{{ alicloud_access_key }}\"\\n\\t\\t\\talicloud_secret_key: \"{{ alicloud_secret_key }}\"\\n\\t\\t\\talicloud_region: \"{{ alicloud_region }}\"\\n\\t\\tregister: instances_by_ids\\n\\n\\t- name: PRINT DATA TO TERMINAL WINDOW\\n\\t\\tdebug:\\n\\t\\t\\tmsg: \"End of tasks\"' script = StringIO(str.expands(2)) # substitute \\t with 2 spaces and create the StringIO object count = NumFactModules(script).count() print('Number of fact modules: ', count) >>> Number of fact modules: 2","title":"Number of fact modules"},{"location":"playbook/NumFactModules/#number-of-fact-modules","text":"It measures the number of facts modules in the script.

Note: role and task variables are included, as well as registered variables . A major use of variables is running a command and registering the result of that command as a variable. When someone executes a task and save the return value in a variable for use in later tasks, s/he creates a registered variable. Example The following example has three variables, namely http_port , app_path and favcolor : --- - hosts: webservers vars: http_port: 80 # 1st variable - hosts: app_servers vars: app_path: \"{{ base_path }}/22\" # 2nd variable - hosts: all remote_user: root vars: favcolor: blue # 3rd variable vars_files: # !!! vars_files is not supported by this version - /vars/external_vars.yml Parameters Type Description Input io.StringIO An ansible playbook Output unsigned int The number of variables Exception TypeError If the type of the input parameter is not io.StringIO yaml.YAMLError If the input file is not a valid yaml How to use Below an example on how to call the metric and the expected output for the provided example: from io import StringIO from ansiblemetrics.playbook.num_vars import NumVars str = '---\\n- hosts: webservers\\n\\tvars:\\n\\t\\thttp_port: 80\\n\\t\\t\\n- hosts: app_servers\\n\\tvars:\\n\\t\\tapp_path: \"{{ base_path }}/22\"\\n\\n- hosts: all\\n\\tremote_user: root\\n\\tvars:\\n\\t\\tfavcolor: blue\\n\\tvars_files:\\n\\t\\t- /vars/external_vars.yml' script = StringIO(str.expands(2)) # substitute \\t with 2 spaces and create the StringIO object count = NumVars(script).count() print('Number of variables: ', count) >>> Number of variables: 3","title":"Number of variables"},{"location":"playbook/NumVars/#number-of-variables","text":"It measures the number of playbooks variables in the script.
